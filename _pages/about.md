Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Alexey Denisevich, known as "leshcat", and that's, you've guessed it, my website.

It is mainly dedicated to IT Tech & Management topics, take a DevOps subject for an instance.

Hopefully my posts will be of value to you in finding the answers for the questions that presumably brought you here in a first place.

If it's not, well...don't give up, recall wise words of Samuel Beckett:

*"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better"* :wink:
