## Rise of the DevOps: "The Three Ways"

At least for me, The Real Game Changer became a book ["Project Phoenix"](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592){:target="_blank"} by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr & George Spafford.

Presented as a novel, it introduced many interesting thoughts like what "the Change" & Change Management toolset are, overall Engineering Goals, what happens when the Org's tech debt and bottlenecks aren't taken seriously (spoiler: your Biz will be disrupted often until full halt).

However, most importantly, "Project Phoenix" introduced pivotal principles called "The Three Ways":
* The Flow
* The Feedback Loop
* Continuous Experimentation & Learning

on which modern vision of DevOps as a Methodology is based on.

## DevOps Expansion: "The DevOps Handbook"

Further expansion of those ideas resulted in a must-read book by DevOps Engineer (and frankly speaking by everyone in the Org):
["The DevOps Handbook"](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=devops+handbook&qid=1623762578&s=books&sr=1-1){:target="_blank"} by Gene Kim, Patrick Debois, John Willis, Jez Humble & John Allspaw.

Among loads of helpful knowledge, it has an invaluable technical practices of what each Way consists of & how to apply it.

## DevOps Principles Cheatsheet: "DevOps Handbook"

In order to simplify the overall mass of data covered in "Handbook", I 've took a liberty to *generically* visualise it in One Picture, emphasising on "Three Ways":

## Conclusion

In my humble opinion, this Book was a solid step forward for all DevOps movement out there: fresh, elaborate and consistent view that offered numerous practical steps to come closer to a working model of DevOps *Methodology* :fire:

Moreover, looks like that complying to "Three Ways" automatically forms a "DevOps culture"...or it's not? :confused:

Since 2016, the book's published date, the progress on the matter didn't stop and "Three Ways" were moderately augmented.

How?

See in the next post :wink:
