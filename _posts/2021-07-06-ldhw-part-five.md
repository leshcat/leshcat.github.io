  DevOps Methodology in 2021: "DevOps Culture and Mindset" Course to an aid!

---

Welcome back,

To complete on "3 Ways" vision, i 've selected Coursera's course: [DevOps Culture and Mindset](https://www.coursera.org/learn/devops-culture-and-mindset) offered by University of California, Davis.

Why did i choose this course out of hundreds around?

Well, for three main reasons:

First: The instructor for this course, [Courtney Kissler](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/ckissler) "was there when magic was written" :copyright:, as she:

* Participated in "Value Stream Mapping" Chapter of ["The DevOps Handbook"](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=devops+handbook&qid=1623762578&s=books&sr=1-1)
* Wrote a foreword for ["Accelerate"](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339)
* Noted in acknowledgements in [“The Unicorn Project”](https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Project-Developers-Disruption-Thriving-ebook/dp/B07QT9QR41)

Second: That's the #1 course on my memory that was expecting non-technical practical tasks to be completed in order to move forward with training

Third: i've [passed the course]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/Coursera_DVPZCXRCH94W.pdf) and it is aligned my vision :wink:

So, what's new?

The **Systems Thinking**!

I personally like the definition by [techtarget.com](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/systems-thinking):

>Systems thinking is a holistic approach to analysis that focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systems.

From [DevOps Culture and Mindset](https://www.coursera.org/learn/devops-culture-and-mindset) standpoint, Systems Thinking:
* Emphasises on performance of the entire System "as opposed to performance of the specific silo, workgroup or the team" :copyright:
* Enables collaboration across functional lines, breaking down the silos
* Focuses on IT enabled Value Streams (Make sure to check out the ["Value Stream Mapping"](https://www.amazon.com/Value-Stream-Mapping-Organizational-Transformation/dp/0071828915) book)

Another priceless takeaway are **Outcomes** (not to be confused with *Outputs*), provided by each of Three Ways.

I 've took the liberty to incorporate all this knowledge in Three Ways Diagram and now it looks like a handy cheatsheet:

Back in the days, you could enroll to the [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/devops-culture-and-mindset) for *50$ USD*, and now apparently it is free to our benefit, therefore, it is strongly encouraged to find the time (50 bucks too if there is still a fee) and study it hard by everyone who takes DevOps seriously.

Trust me on this, you won't regret it!

Okay, we are now weaponised with up-to-date DevOps Methodology Structure, its Core Principles, practices around them and can explain what actual outcomes they provide.

But how do we actually proceed with implementing it?

We'll talk about it in the next post :wink:

Stay Frosty,
