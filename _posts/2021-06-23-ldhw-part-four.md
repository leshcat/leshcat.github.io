  How "Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps" contributes to DevOps Methodology?

---

Published in 2018, ["Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology"](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339) by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble & Gene Kim quickly became the bestseller among IT Leadership & Management alike.

It could not pass my attention either as i am always ready to get more clarifications and guidance on DevOps Methodology practical application.

At the end of the day the title had a *"The Science of .. DevOps"* excerpt, right? :wink:

Briefly, "Accelerate" covers very interesing topics, for example:
- Westrum's typology of organizational cultures
- eNPS (eNPS Employee Net Promoter Score)
- Fighting People's Burnouts
- Defining Managers, Leaders and Leadership and their roles
- Transformational Leadership characteristics

and many-many more "here and there" valuable takeaways, all backed up by research they did/used while writing the Book.

"Accelerate" has also an "Ace in the Sleeve" - 3rd part of the book: "Transformation", my personal favourite.

Simply put: how do you actually shift from current state of things in your Org to a proposed one:
among numerous methods you can find well-known ["Spotify Organizational Structure"](https://youtu.be/Yvfz4HGtoPc) and a very handy "Team, Management & Leadership practices" Martix (Figure 16.4: High-Performance Team, Management, and Leadership Behaviors and Practices).

However, from enginnering standpoint, pretty much nothing changed to ["Three Ways"]({% post_url 2021-06-15-ldhw-part-three %}).

Moreover, i find peculiar the fact, that while the technical practices in "Accelerate" Book remained if not identical, than pretty much the same in comparison to ["DevOps Handbook"](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=devops+handbook&qid=1623762578&s=books&sr=1-1), i have failed to find any mentions of the "Three Ways" despite that 2 authors of "Handbook" were participating in creating "Accelerate".

Nonetheless, 2 valuable additions to "the Flow" and "the Learning" principles were discovered, namely:

- ["TBD: Trunk Based Development"](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) (Ensure to check it out!)
- Demo Days

and this is how they align on DevOps Principles schema (new marked with yellow circles):

To sum up, in my humble opinion "Accelerate" is designed for Managers & Leadership of all levels in a first place...which might discourage some engineers from reading it. By **ALL** means please don't!

As reading it from cover to cover, will grant you the least minumum - the knowledge of what to expect from Management and in best case scenario - you, my friend, the DevOps Engineer, will start shifting from simply *Using* tools & *Applying* practices to a much more meaninful **Establishing** DevOps Methodology, completely aligned with Higher Command :wink:
