  Recently I've gained AWS Architect Professional Certification.
  Here is a quick overwiew and few tips that might be helpful for you!
---

I went with:
cloudguru (so-so source of exam tickets, however, updated weekly(?) to match exam requirements): https://learn.acloud.guru/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional/dashboard
again cloudguru to learn things that are not covered in main professional level (as twinmaker or fleetwise), just use search
https://www.whizlabs.com to train your speed
Exam topics: https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-sap-c02/view/1/ to have a good practice up to 22 views for free (personally - bad source of exam tickets but good overall for training your understanding)
Sample questions from aws: https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-pro/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Professional_Sample-Questions.pdf - some of them were on exam
Overall, all this training took 2 months.
Pretty much none of those sources were useful for exact tickets but formed a good understanding of what and how to select right answers.
General advices:
Don’t overthink it. Answer according to requirements given
Exclude Wrong answers first
Always check the words “BEST SUITABLE” or “LEAST OPERATIONAL OVERHEAD” or “CHEAPEST” etc. KNOW WHAT IT MEANS: https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-adoption-framework/
If you hesitate between 2 answers - choose 2nd, game theory in practice
When it comes to answers with numbers, memorize Timeouts times for Lambda, API gateway, sizes of shards in Kinesis
Never pick up Lambda when the app has to work continuously, every 10 min or more than 15 min
Your test runs in all those sources should be 85% or more. Always retrain yourself
Flag questions, its important, specially for 1st 10 questions. Due to stress, you are likely to pick up wrong answers. Review at the end when all knowledge is loaded up to your brain.
